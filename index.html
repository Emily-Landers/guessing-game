        <p>Hello, my name is <strong>Joe Streifel</strong>. I created this page to experiment with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I don't have a complete formal education in programming yet but I'm getting there!</p>
        <p>I have <strong>1 year of university</strong> under my belt. After dropping out I enlisted in the <strong>Marine Corps</strong> where I recieved an education in electronics maintenance, repair, and calibration.</p>
        <p>After my enlistment in the Marine Corps, I worked for a private company calibrating <strong>biomedical and aviation</strong> test equipment.</p>
        <p>Today, I'm training to become a software developer, and attending a bootcamp called <strong>Code Fellows</strong> to hone my skills eventually make development my career!</p>
